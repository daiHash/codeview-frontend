Frontend for the Codeview web app

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:8080/api/hello](http://localhost:8080/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
